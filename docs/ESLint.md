## ESLint Setup
We use ```ESLint``` as our linter to auto-format files, enforce naming conventions (PascalCase + camelCase) on ```TypeScript``` + TSX syntax, and make helpful code suggestions. It also ensures that developers follow a consistent formatting across the codebase. Download the ```ESLINT``` extension on your editor (ex. ```VsCode```, ```Vim```, etc.). We recommend creating a keyboard shortcut to run  the linter! This auto-formats a file with our enforced ```React``` and ```TypeScript``` guidelines.

Try not to use conflicting formatters like ```Prettier``` which may conflict with ```ESLint```.

Besides shortcuts, can run ```ESLint``` on a specific file or entire directory with terminal commands:
```
npx --fix eslint [path]
npx --fix eslint [path]
```
