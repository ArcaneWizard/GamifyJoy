## ESLint Setup
We use ESLint as our linter. Download the extension on your editor (ex. VsCode, Vim, etc.) and create
a keyboard shortcut to run  the linter! It will auto-format a file with our enforced react and typescript guidelines.
Try not to use conflicting formatters like Prettier which may conflict with ESLint.

To run ESLint on a specific path or directory, you can use the terminal commands:
```
npx --fix eslint [path]
npx --fix eslint [path]
```
